##Because "read more" isn't good enough
Turn your "More" links into a bespoke call-to-action for each post. Rather than have "Read more" or "[...]" after your excerpt, you could have "See Bob's garden up close" in a post about a beautiful garden, or "Try our tasty sauce" in a bolognese sauce recipe.
